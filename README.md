# FloatTalk

Ideas from the discussion:

    Bottles are tied to a specific location, you can read it only while being at the location. Like geocashing
    The range should be adjustable either by time or by the amount of people opening the bottle. Probably by user prompting >>> how long should your bottle stay accessible?


for backend:throw a bottle
